# HideArmour
An ultra-lightweight mod that hides own armor on the client side, and can specify whether the 4 armor slots need to be hidden.

The old MOD had many problems, so I abandoned it and rewrote it directly.

# Usage
Put this mod into the `mods` directory and launch the game

## 1.8.9-1.12.2-forge
Use client command`/hidearmour` or `/hidearmor`

- `true` - Enable
- `false` - Disable
- `status` - Show status
- `reload` - Reload config

The configuration file is located at `.minecraft/config/hidearmour.cfg`

## 1.19.3-24w11a-fabric
Install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), then click configuration in the mod menu.

The configuration file is located at `.minecraft/config/hide-armour.yml`
